// Package sql implements the blockchain.Store interface using SQL database backends.
// It provides concrete SQL-based implementations for all blockchain operations
// defined in the interface, with support for different SQL engines.
//
// This file implements the GetBlocksMinedNotSet method, which retrieves blocks that
// have been stored in the blockchain database but have not yet had their mining status
// properly recorded. This functionality is important for mining operations and blockchain
// analytics, ensuring that all blocks are properly tagged with their mining origin.
// The implementation uses a straightforward SQL query to identify blocks with the mined_set
// flag set to false, which typically indicates blocks that were received from the network
// but whose mining status needs to be verified or updated. This method supports Teranode's
// mining infrastructure by ensuring accurate tracking of locally mined blocks versus
// those received from the network.

// GetBlocksMinedNotSet retrieves blocks whose mining status has not been properly recorded.
// This implements a specialized blockchain query method not directly defined in the Store interface.
//
// In blockchain systems like Teranode that support mining operations, it's important to
// accurately track which blocks were mined locally versus those received from the network.
// This method identifies blocks that have been stored in the blockchain database but have
// not yet had their mining status properly recorded (mined_set flag is false).
//
// This functionality serves several important purposes:
//   - Supports post-processing of blocks to update their mining status
//   - Enables accurate mining statistics and analytics
//   - Helps identify blocks that may need additional verification
//   - Facilitates mining pool integration by ensuring proper attribution of mined blocks
//
// The implementation queries blocks with subtrees_set=true AND mined_set=false.
// The subtrees_set=true filter ensures we only return blocks that have completed
// subtree validation (whether valid or invalid), preventing infinite waits on blocks
// that will never be fully processed. This is used by:
//   - BlockValidation's periodic job to process blocks needing mined status updates
//   - BlockValidation.isParentMined() to check if parent blocks are ready
//   - SubtreeProcessor.WaitForPendingBlocks() to wait for all blocks to be processed
//
// The query is ordered by height to process blocks in chronological order.
//
// Parameters:
//   - ctx: Context for the database operation, allowing for cancellation and timeouts
//
// Returns:
//   - []*model.Block: An array of complete block objects whose mining status needs to be set
//   - error: Any error encountered during retrieval, specifically:
//   - StorageError for database errors or processing failures

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
	defer cancel()

	// Only return blocks where subtrees_set = true AND mined_set = false.
	//
	// Why we check subtrees_set = true:
	// - Ensures BlockValidation has finished processing the block's subtrees (either valid or invalid)
	// - Prevents waiting for blocks that will never be fully processed (e.g., blocks with missing subtrees)
	// - Includes both valid blocks and invalid blocks (marked invalid after validation) that need mined status set
	//
	// This allows BlockValidation's periodic job to process invalidated blocks (set via InvalidateBlock RPC)
	// which have subtrees_set = true but need their transaction status updated (setTxMined with invalid=true).
