// RegionSettings configures geographic region information.
type RegionSettings struct {
	Name string `key:"regionName" desc:"Region name identifier" default:"defaultRegionName" category:"Region" usage:"Identifies geographic region" type:"string" longdesc:"### Purpose\nHuman-readable name for the geographic region where this node is deployed.\n\n### How It Works\nUsed for regional service discovery, latency-aware peer selection, and operational metrics grouping. Appears in node status, peer lists, and monitoring dashboards to help operators understand deployment topology.\n\n### Common Formats\n- **Cloud region names** - us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2\n- **Datacenter codes** - NYC1, LON2, SFO3\n- **Custom identifiers** - office-main, colo-primary\n\n### Recommendations\n- Set to a meaningful value in production (default **defaultRegionName** is a placeholder)\n- Use consistent naming conventions across your deployment\n- Match cloud provider region names when running in cloud environments"`

// AdvertisingSettings configures node advertising behavior.
type AdvertisingSettings struct {
	Interval string `key:"advertisingInterval" desc:"Interval for advertising node status" default:"10s" category:"Advertising" usage:"How often to broadcast status" type:"string" longdesc:"### Purpose\nControls how frequently this node broadcasts its status to the peer network.\n\n### How It Works\nAt each interval, the node advertises its current status including capabilities, sync height, and availability. Peers use this information for discovery and connection decisions.\n\n### Format\nGo duration string (e.g., **10s**, **1m**, **30s**, **5m**).\n\n### Trade-offs\n| Interval | Network Overhead | Peer Information Accuracy |\n|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| Shorter (5s) | Higher | More current |\n| Default (10s) | Balanced | Reasonably current |\n| Longer (30s+) | Lower | May become stale |\n\n### Recommendations\n- Default **10s** works well for most deployments\n- Use shorter intervals in dynamic environments with frequent peer changes\n- Use longer intervals to reduce bandwidth in stable networks"`
	URL      string `key:"advertisingURL" desc:"URL for node advertising" default:"defaultAdvertisingURL" category:"Advertising" usage:"Endpoint for node discovery" type:"string" longdesc:"### Purpose\nThe externally reachable address advertised to peers for connecting to this node.\n\n### How It Works\nPeer discovery mechanisms use this URL to locate and establish connections to this node. The URL must be accessible from outside your network for peers to connect successfully.\n\n### Format Options\n- **HTTP URL** - http://node.example.com:8080\n- **P2P multiaddress** - /ip4/192.168.1.1/tcp/9905\n- **Custom format** - Depends on your advertising protocol\n\n### Recommendations\n- Default **defaultAdvertisingURL** is a placeholder - must be configured for peer discovery\n- Ensure the URL is externally reachable (not localhost or internal-only addresses)\n- Include the correct port for your P2P service\n- Update this value when your nodes public IP or hostname changes"`
