	DevServerPorts []int  `key:"dashboard_devServerPorts" desc:"Vite dev server ports for dashboard" default:"[5173,4173]" category:"Dashboard" usage:"Ports where Vite dev server runs" type:"[]int" longdesc:"### Purpose\nIdentifies Vite development server ports for automatic WebSocket URL configuration during local development.\n\n### How It Works\nThe dashboard uses these ports to detect when running in development mode. When a request originates from one of these ports, WebSocket connections are configured to use the separate Asset service port instead of the same origin.\n\n### Values\n- **5173** - Primary Vite dev server with hot module replacement (HMR)\n- **4173** - Vite preview server for testing production builds locally\n\n### Recommendations\n- Default values match standard Vite ports\n- Only modify if Vite is configured to use non-standard ports\n- These settings only affect developers working on the dashboard UI"`
	WebSocketPort  string `key:"dashboard_websocketPort" desc:"WebSocket port for dashboard real-time updates" default:"8090" category:"Dashboard" usage:"Used for live data streaming to dashboard" type:"string" longdesc:"### Purpose\nSpecifies the port for WebSocket connections to the Centrifuge real-time streaming server during development.\n\n### How It Works\nWhen the dashboard detects it is running on a development server port, it constructs WebSocket URLs using this port to connect to the Asset service. In production, WebSocket connections use the same port as the HTTP request.\n\n### Format\nPort number as string (e.g., \"8090\").\n\n### Recommendations\n- Should match the Asset service HTTP listen port (asset_httpListenAddress)\n- **8090** (default) - Standard Asset service port"`
	WebSocketPath  string `key:"dashboard_websocketPath" desc:"WebSocket path for dashboard connections" default:"/connection/websocket" category:"Dashboard" usage:"Path for WebSocket upgrade requests" type:"string" longdesc:"### Purpose\nSpecifies the URL path for WebSocket upgrade requests to the Centrifuge server.\n\n### How It Works\nThe dashboard appends this path to the WebSocket base URL when establishing real-time connections.\n\n### Format\nFull URL format: ws://{host}:{port}{path}\n\nExample: ws://localhost:8090/connection/websocket\n\n### Recommendations\n- Must match the path where Asset service Centrifuge server accepts WebSocket upgrades\n- **Default path is standard** - only change if Centrifuge is configured differently"`
